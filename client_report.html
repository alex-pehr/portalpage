<h2>Client Report</h2>

<p>
I decided what content and images to use by focusing on the purpose of my site, which is to showcase music I have created. I chose simple text and visuals that highlight my songs and give visitors an idea of who I am as a creator.
</p>

<p>
I communicated with my developer by clearly explaining what I wanted the site to include and how it should look. Communication went well overall, and there were no major issues that caused delays or confusion.
</p>

<p>
My developer met my expectations by following the site plan and building a clean, functional website. The final result matched what I had in mind based on the wireframes and requirements.
</p>

<p>
Next time I hire a team, I would provide even more detailed examples early on to make the process smoother and faster.

<h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>

<p>
As the lead developer, I managed tasks by breaking the project into smaller parts and focusing on one section at a time. This made it easier to stay organized and complete each requirement.
</p>

<p>
Communication with the client was clear and consistent. There were no major issues, and feedback was easy to apply to the project.
</p>

<p>
I handled publishing the site by creating a GitHub repository and enabling GitHub Pages. Once published, I shared the link so the site could be viewed online.
</p>

<p>
Managing the site with GitHub was a good learning experience. It helped me understand version control and how to host a website properly.

<h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>

<p>
As a junior developer, I communicated with my team lead by asking questions when I was unsure and following instructions closely. Communication was clear and helpful.
</p>

<p>
I understood what was expected of me for each site and was able to contribute by working on HTML structure and basic styling.
</p>

<p>
I was able to contribute meaningfully to the sites and improve my confidence in writing code.
</p>

<p>
I ran into a few minor issues with GitHub at first, but I was able to resolve them by practicing commits and pushes.

<h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>

<p>
The most challenging part of this project was managing all the requirements at once. I overcame this by working step by step and checking the rubric often.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed seeing the site come together and being able to publish it online.
</p>

<p>
If I could do the project again, I would start planning earlier and organize my files more carefully from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
I feel more confident working on real world projects after this experience because I now understand the full process from planning to publishing.
